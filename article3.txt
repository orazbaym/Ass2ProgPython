Music is an art whose production is very difficult. Artists work for years just to produce one song. 
Every song produced by an artist is unique. Music plagiarism is an insult to these peoples work because the 
plagiarizer doesnt know the blood sweat and toil that goes into one song. Music plagiarism is not a new 
phenomena. It has been going for many years. However only recently with access to the internet and there by a 
huge range of song we have come to realise just how many songs are fake. The problem with this detecting 
plagiarism is that people are biased. So they cant be wholly relied on. Another thing is that when proving 
plagiarism especially in a court of law perception of people (experts)can vary. What is needed is a way to 
quantitatively and scientifically prove plagiarism in music. This will lead to a more reliable accurate and 
effective means of detection. our project set out to be a beacon of truth to expose plagiarizers and give back 
dignity to the art that is music.
By using mfcc, entropy and mean energy level we have created a robust fingerprinting algorithm 
,which enables us to differentiate copies from original music.these three features have been chosen because of 
two major considerations.The first being that an algorithm that is extremely efficient meaning that it pin points 
plagiarism easily and without error. The second consideration is the processing time that is the time required for 
our algorithm to obtain a result.through out the project. We struggle to balance these two factors and finally we 
decided to take these three factors. par Our comparison through taking the Euclidian distance of vector 
quantisation of features mentioned above allows us to do so. Inspite the rise of plagiarism in reason years we 
believe this algorithm could be usefull in playing a vital role in stamping out plagiarism. More features can be 
added and the code can be better optimised so in the future music plagiarism becomes a thing of the past.

Abstract: Music plagiarism detector is an alternative approach for music genre classification which converts 
the audio signal into spectrograms and then extracts features from this visual representation. The idea is that 
treating the time-frequency representation as a texture image we can extract features to build reliable music 
genre classification systems. The proposed approach also takes into account a zoning mechanism to perform 
local feature extraction, which has been proved to be quite efficient. The feature include MFCC, energy, entropy 
etc. In this we suggest a method for indexing the features extracted from every melody and a method for 
processing plagiarism detection by using the index. With our plagiarism detection system, composers can easily 
search for the melodies similar to their ones from music databases. Furthermore, for applications such as radio 
monitoring, search times on the order of a few milliseconds per query are attained, even on a massive music 
database.
