Introduction 
Recently, the use of various types of multimedia data such as images, videos, and 
audios has shown its explosive growth, so the content-based search became of great 
importance[12][7][13][5][4][3]. For the successful content-based search, an indexing 
scheme and a query processing scheme are the key issues to be considered. Despite of 
its great advance, audio search has been less investigated than either image or video 
searches [8]. 
In this paper, we address the development of a system that detects plagiarism 
based on the similar melody searching, which is an operation that finds the melodies 
similar to a given query melody from a music database. Specifically, the plagiarism 
detection system is to examine if there exist such melodies in music databases as 
being similar to any melodies of a composerís interest. Without realizing it, any composers may be involved in diverse plagiarism disputes. The main purpose of this 
research is to help composers to avoid unnecessary plagiarism disputes by using the 
plagiarism detection system in advance. 
Unlike such previous systems as [6][8][9][10], our plagiarism detection system has 
its unique characteristics as follows: 
• A novel similarity model: it solves the problem of misjudgment by supporting 
alignment as well as shifting in the similarity model. 
• Multidimensional indexing: it makes a basic framework for fast searching by employing a multidimensional index built on melody features.

• A three-step query processing: it provides fast search ability by taking a three-step 
query processing method, which consists of index searching, window stitching, 
and post-processing. 
The results of performance evaluation show that our approach outperforms the sequential-scan-based one in the speed of searching up to around 31 times. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes a novel similarity model for 
computing the similarity between two different melodies. Section 3 discusses an indexing method for efficient similar melody searching from melody databases. Section 
4 presents a three-step query processing method which employs the proposed indexing method. To show its superiority, we evaluate the performance of our system in 
Section 5. Finally, Section 6 summarizes and concludes the paper. 
2 Similarity Model 
This section describes a similarity model to compute the similarity between two different melodies. 
2.1 Basic Model 
A melody of a music is defined as a list of snatches, i.e. as a sequence S = <(si, sLi)> 
(0<=i<n), called a melody sequence. Here, si denotes the ith tone of a melody, and sLi
denotes the length of the ith tone of a melody. Also, the number of tones, n, is called 
the length of a melody sequence. For example, the following melody with a C major 
key in four-quarters time is described as a melody sequence of length 4, i.e. <(sol, 1), 
(la, 1/2), (la, 1/2), (fa, 2)>1. 
For comparison of any two melody sequences S = <(si, sLi)>(0<=i<n) and Q = 
<(qj, qLj)>(0<=j<m), we make the following assumptions: 
• Assumption 1: S and Q should have the same meter. In other words, two melody 
sequences of different meters are excluded for similarity searching. 
• Assumption 2: It always holds that n=m and sLi = qLj if i=j, for all (i, j)'s. Thus, 
two melody sequences to be compared should be of the same length, and the 
lengths of their corresponding tones should be also the same. 
For any two melody sequences S and Q satisfying these assumptions, the similarity 
between S and Q is computed based on Definition 1 described below. 

This paper addresses the development of a system that detects plagiarism based on similar melody searching. Similar melody searching is to find 
the melodies similar to a given query melody from a music database. For this 
purpose, we propose a novel similarity model that supports alignment as well as 
shifting. Also, we suggest a method for indexing the features extracted from 
every melody, and a method for processing plagiarism detection by using the 
index. With our plagiarism detection system, composers can easily search for 
the melodies similar to their ones from music databases. Through performance 
evaluation via a series of experiments, we show the effectiveness of our approach. The results reveal that our approach outperforms the sequential-scanbased one in speed up to around 31 times.
